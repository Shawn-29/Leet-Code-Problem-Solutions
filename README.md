# Shawn Leet Code Solutions
This repository contains a sample of my solutions for various programming challenges featured on Leet Code. Solutions are coded primarily in JavaScript.

Leet Code is a website that provides users with real coding problems to help them prepare for technical interviews. Solutions are run through an "Online Judge," which checks solutions for correctness and provides speed and memory statistics compared to other users' submissions.
